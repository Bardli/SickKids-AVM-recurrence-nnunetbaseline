Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated and will be changed in pytorch 2.9; use x[tuple(seq)] instead of x[seq]. In pytorch 2.9 this will be interpreted as tensor index, x[torch.tensor(seq)], which will result either in an error or a different result (Triggered internally at /pytorch/torch/csrc/autograd/python_variable_indexing.cpp:306.)
